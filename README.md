## Features

- Clears and updates a Spotify playlist with unique tracks

- Configurable timezone support

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Spotify Developer Account
- Spotify playlist (public or private)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radio-playlist-updater.git
cd radio-playlist-updater
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install requests
```

3. Copy the configuration template:
```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

## Configuration

### Step 1: Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in the app details
4. Add exactly this Redirect URI: `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`
5. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Configure the Script

Edit `config.json` and add your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret:

```json
{
    "spotify": {
        "client_id": "your_actual_client_id_here",
        "client_secret": "your_actual_client_secret_here",
        ...
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Get Refresh Token

Run the setup process to authenticate with Spotify:

```bash
python spotify_tunegenie_updater.py --setup
```

This will:
1. Open your browser for Spotify authorization
2. Redirect to a page showing "You've been authenticated!"
3. Display your refresh token
4. Optionally update your config.json automatically

### Step 4: Add Playlist ID

1. Right-click on your target playlist in Spotify
2. Select "Share" â†’ "Copy link to playlist"
3. Extract the ID from the URL: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/[PLAYLIST_ID]`
4. Add it to your `config.json`

## Usage

### Manual Run

Run the script to update your playlist with yesterday's songs:

```bash
python spotify_tunegenie_updater.py
```

### Automated Daily Updates

#### Linux/macOS (cron)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line to run daily at 1 AM
0 1 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/spotify_tunegenie_updater.py
```

#### Windows (Task Scheduler)

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger: Daily
4. Set action: Start a program
   - Program: `python.exe`
   - Arguments: `C:\path\to\spotify_tunegenie_updater.py`

## Configuration Options

### Timezone

The default timezone is Eastern Time (-04:00). To change it, edit the `timezone_offset` in `config.json`:

```json
"timezone_offset": "-05:00"  // For EST or CDT
```

### Radio Station

To use a different station (if supported by TuneGenie), modify:

```json
"tunegenie": {
    "brand": "your_station_code"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Songs Not Found

Some songs might not be found on Spotify due to:
- Different artist name formatting
- Different song title formatting
- Regional availability restrictions
- Songs not available on Spotify

The script will show which songs couldn't be found and continue with the rest.

### Token Expired

If you get authentication errors, run the setup process again:

```bash
python spotify_tunegenie_updater.py --setup
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `config.json`** to Git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your Client Secret secure
- The refresh token doesn't expire but can be revoked from your Spotify account
